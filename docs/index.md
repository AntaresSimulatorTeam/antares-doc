# Antares documentation
[Antares-Simulator](https://antares-simulator.org/) is an Open Source (GNU GPL 3.0) power system simulator
meant to be used by anybody placing value in quantifying the adequacy or
the economic performance of interconnected energy systems, at short or remote time horizons.
With an adequate modelling of the energy consumption, generation and transportation,
the software performs probabilistic simulations of the system throughout many year-long
scenarios made of 8760 hourly time-frames each.

Transmission system Operators, Power and Gas Producers, Regulators, Academics,
Consultants, NGO and all others actors concerned by energy policy issues are welcome to use the software. 

The detailed documentation of Antares_Simulator can be found [here](https://antares-simulator.readthedocs.io).

## Additional packages
This documentation is meant not only to present the functionalities of Antares_Simulator, its user guide and the theoretical 
model it uses, but also the software that work together with the simulator:

- [_R_-packages](https://rte-antares-rpackage.github.io/rPackagesRte/) aimed at the preparation, post-processing and visualisation of Antares simulations
- [Antares_xpansion](https://antares-xpansion.readthedocs.io) that optimizes the installed capacities of an ANTARES study
- [Antares_Simulator](https://antares-simulator.readthedocs.io)
- Antares_Launcher that allows to run Antares simulations on a remote dedicated machine (that have a suitable Antares installation)
